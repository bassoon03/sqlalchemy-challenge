This file contains the climate starter code and the app.py code for the SQLAlchemy Challenge. 
In order to run the app.py code, one must be in the correct directory or else the code will not run. To make sure that one is in the correct directory, make sure the code is, at first, not running. If it is running, 
type ctrl + C into the terminal. Then type cd "Starter Code for SQLAlchemy Challenge" into the terminal. This will put the user into the correct directory. The code can now be run.
As far as resources are concerned, I used the recordings of our class sessions, as well as some of the Flask documentation. The app.py section required a lot of help from the instructor and TA. Other resources are 
Lizzy from StackOverflow, Ilja Everila from StackOverflow, and Martin Krol on groups.google.
